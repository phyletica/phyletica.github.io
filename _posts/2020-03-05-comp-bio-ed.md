We have published an
[opinion article about the ins-and-outs of
teaching computational biology](https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1854/v2)
in
[F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/).
This work was born from a fantastic
[iEvoBio](https://www.ievobio.org/) Meeting in Providence,
Rhode Island last Summer.
The meeting was organized by
[April Wright](https://paleantology.com/the-wright-lab/)
and focused on "enabling the next generation of computational biologists".
The paper was a lot of fun to work on, thanks to great collaborators
[April Wright](https://paleantology.com/the-wright-lab/),
[Rachel Schwartz](https://schwartzlaburi.github.io/),
[Catherine Newman](https://www.catherinenewman.org/),
and
[Sarah Flanagan](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/contact-us/academic-staff/sarah-flanagan.html).
