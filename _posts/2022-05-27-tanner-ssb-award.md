## Congrats, Tanner!

Congratulations to

Tanner Myers
for receiving the
[Graduate Student Research Award](https://www.systbio.org/graduate-student-research-awards.html)
from the
[Society of Systematic Biologists](https://www.systbio.org/)
to study (among other things) if a large chromosomal inversion reduces gene
flow along a hybrid zone between two lineages of fence lizards.
