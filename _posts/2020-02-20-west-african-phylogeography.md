Recent work in collaboration with
[Adam Leache](http://faculty.washington.edu/leache/wordpress/),
[Caleb Ofori-Boateng](https://csir-forig.org.gh/senior-members-profiles/309-caleb-ofori-boateng-phd),
and
[Matt Fujita](https://fujitalab.com/)
is out in
[Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.13941)
on the comparative phylogeography of a diverse set of reptiles and amphibians
from West Africa.
We used computational methods developed in the Phyletica Lab to infer the
temporal distribution of divergences among 20 species across the Dahomey Gap.
We found a lot of variation in divergence times, suggesting that species
responded differently to past aridification across West Africa.
