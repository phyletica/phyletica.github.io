The 2021 Mathematical, Inferential, and Computational Phylogenomics (MIC-Phy)
meeting was great. Lots of great
[posters](https://mrborges23.github.io/micphy2021/posters),
[talks](https://mrborges23.github.io/micphy2021/talks)
and
[workshops](https://mrborges23.github.io/micphy2021/workshop).
I was only bummed about the talks I missed due to the difference in time zones.
But, luckily, most of the
[talks are now up online](https://mrborges23.github.io/micphy2021/program),
so I'm eager to catch up on what I missed.

I presented some new work by
[JR](https://perryleewoodjr.com/)
and I,
where we generalized the space of trees explored during Bayesian phylogenetic
inference in order to infer shared and multifurcating divergences.
Based on simulations, the new approach can accurately infer such
branching patterns from genomic data.
Equally important, it does not spuriously support such patterns when
divergences are independent and bifurcating.
Using this approach, we found evidence for the signature of interglacial rises
in sea levels fragmenting the Philippine Islands in the phylogenies of two
genera of geckos.
