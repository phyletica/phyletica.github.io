## Welcome Morgan!

The Phyletical Lab is happy to welcome new Ph.D. student,
[Morgan Muell](https://morganmuell.wixsite.com/home).
Morgan joins us from the lab of
[Jason Brown](https://www.jasonleebrown.org/)
at
[Southern Illinois University](https://siu.edu/),
where she did her master's work on the phylogenomics and color pattern
evolution in poison frogs.
Morgan will be coadvised by
[Dan Warner](https://warnerlab.weebly.com/),
and is interested in taking a comparative approach to the evolution of
phenotypic plasticity.
