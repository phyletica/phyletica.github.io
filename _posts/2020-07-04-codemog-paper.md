While we avoid mass-infection events this 4th of July, here's a 
piece of good news out of the Phyletica Lab.
The work by 
Nadia L'Bahy (our 2018 Comp Bio REU student from UMass Amherst)
and Kerry that introduces a new, full-likelihood, Bayesian approach
to estimating simultaneous changes in effective population sizes
across populations is now published in the journal
[Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.14052).
It turns out that, even when you use all the information from genomic data,
estimating shared demographic events across populations is still super hard.
