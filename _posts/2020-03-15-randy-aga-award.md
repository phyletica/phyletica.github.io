## Congrats Randy!

Congratulations to
[Randy Klabacka](http://randyklabacka.com/)
for being awarded $8,000 from the
[American Genetics Association](https://www.theaga.org/eecg-awards.php)
to study the genomic and bioenergetic costs of asexuality
in whiptail lizards.
We are interested in whether a non-recombining nuclear genome can adequately
coevolve with the mitochondria.
