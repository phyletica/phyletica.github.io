I just got back to Auburn after a fun visit to the
[Center for Genomic and Computational Biology](https://biostat.duke.edu/research/duke-center-genomic-and-computational-biology)
at
[Duke University](https://duke.edu/)
to give a seminar.
One of the highlights of the visit was spending time with the graduate students
of the Computational Biology & Bionformatics Program.
They asked great questions after the seminar and at our lunch together.

Many thanks to CBB Ph.D. student [Devang Thakkar](https://www.devangthakkar.com/)
for inviting me to speak and organizing my visit.

Here are the slides from my talk:
