[Randy's](http://randyklabacka.com/)
paper on the diversification of flying lizards across Indochina is now
[published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106861).
Randy found that a model of diversification demarcated by the major rivers of
Indochina best explained variation in sequence data from across the
distribution of the *Draco maculatus* species complex.
Randy did a ton of work to compare the marginal likelihoods of a large number
of diversification models to reach this conclusion.
Congrats Randy!
