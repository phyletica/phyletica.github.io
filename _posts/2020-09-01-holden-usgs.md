## Holden moving on to the USGS

Congratulations to undergraduate
Holden Smith
for accepting a position at the United States Geological Survey.
Holden will be working as a Hydrologic Technician out of he Lower Mississippi
Gulf Water Science Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
He will be collecting important hydrologic data from extremely diverse
drainages, such as the Tennessee, Alabama, Tombigbee, and Mobile Rivers.
We will miss him in the lab, but we are glad to know he will be looking out for
the diverse waterways of the southeast.
Congrats Holden!
