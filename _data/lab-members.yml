        I am interested in using genomic datasets to inform us about the
        genetic diversity within breeding colonies and wild populations of the
        eastern Indigo Snake, <i>Drymarcon couperi</i>. Using the genomic data
        we will determine if reintroduced populations in southern Alabama have
        ample diversity to be viable long term.  My masters work from Villanova
        University explored the evolution of sea kraits (genus
        <i>Laticauda</i>), and population dynamics of the yellow lipped sea
        krait (<i>Laticauda colubrina</i>).

        My research interests focus on the evolution of phenotypic traits,
        particularly those with potential applications to global change
        biology. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biology from Iowa State
        University in 2018, where I studied how proximate environmental cues
        promote nesting emergence in painted turtles while working in Dr.
        Fredric Janzen's lab. Subsequently, I earned my Masters degree in
        Zoology in 2020 from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, where
        I worked with Dr. Jason L. Brown on phylogenomics and color pattern
        evolution of <i>Ranitomeya</i> poison frogs. In the Phyletica Lab, with
        co-advisement from Dr. Dan Warner, I am taking a comparative approach
        to studying the evolution of developmental plasticity among multiple
        lineages of <i>Anolis</i> lizards, with emphasis on the mainland
        species of Costa Rica. My goal is to examine how developmental
        plasticity is tied to both environment and common ancestry, in order to
        further our understanding of how organisms may respond to changing
        climates. Visit my website to get to know my research and me!

    bio: >
        I am fascinated by the coevolutionary relationship between
        mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. I am interested in the role sexual
        reproduction plays in maintaining a healthy mitonuclear marriage, and
        analyzing the effects of parthenogenesis on mitochondrial dysfunction
        using physiological methods within a phylogenetic context.
